---++ Stop your wiki getting spammed
This plugin attempts to reduce the instance of Wiki Spam by using the
[[http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinWiki][MoinMoin]]
[[http://moinmo.in/AntiSpamGlobalSolution][AntiSpamGlobalSolution]]
regex's.  Anytime it detects that a saved page contains a string in the regex
list, it _only_ refuses to save it.

*Major premise is not to create any unnecessary load on the server and not to use excess server resources by holding connections open.*

All its processing is _only_ done on =save=, or on =attach=.
(Foswiki:Extensions/BlackListPlugin does alot of processing on _every_ topic operation,
including view)

It uses a timeout on save to check if the list has changed, so if there are no
saves, there is no un-needed network traffic.  Alternatively the regex list
can be loaded by a cron script to minimize save overhead.

To manually update the list, click [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"rest"}%/%TOPIC%/forceUpdate][here]]

Note that the retrieve of the !MoinMoin regex list can still take some seconds
which will delay topic saves when the list needs to be refreshed.  For best
performance:
   * Refresh the list using the =rest= script from a scheduled cron job
<verbatim>
cd [foswiki-bin-directory]
./rest /AntiWikiSpamPlugin/forceUpdate
</verbatim>
   * Set the =GETLISTTIMEOUT= to a very large number so that the cron job will be the only source of updates

---++ Configuration

The configuration of this plugin is done using the %SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%
tool.  There are 5 settings used to control the operation and agressiveness of
the spam filter:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Setting* | *Definition* | *Default* |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{ANTISPAMREGEXLISTURL}= | URL containing the public list of regular expressions used to block spam.  The default list is provided by !MoinMoin. | http://arch.thinkmo.de/cgi-bin/spam-merge |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{LOCALANTISPAMREGEXLISTTOPIC}= | A topic containing a list of local regular expressions. A sample topic is provided. | %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamLocalList |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{GETLISTTIMEOUT}= | Maximum age of the public regular expression list in minutes.  When age is exceeded, an updated list will be fetched | 60 |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{BypassGroup}= | A Wiki group listing members who are permitted to save without any Spam checking. Note that members of the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup are always permitted to save. | AntiWikiSpamBypassGroup |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{HitThreshold}= | Number of regex hits required to block the save. Set to -1 to simulate operation.  | 1 |

There is also a DEBUG setting available.  Set it in Main.SitePreferences

<verbatim>
   * Set ANTIWIKISPAMPLUGIN_DEBUG = 1
</verbatim>

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Testing

Edit %SANDBOXWEB%.AntiWikiSpamTestTopic using the Admin user.  (This topic is protected against non-admin access.)  Save will be permitted, but the matching
regular expressions will be logged to the foswiki error log (typically =working/logs/error.log=)

To cause a true failure, remove the VIEW and CHANGE restrictions to the topic and edit it using a non-admin user.
