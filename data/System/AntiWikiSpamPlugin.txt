---++ Stop your wiki getting spammed

This plugin attempts to reduce the instance of Wiki Spam by using the [[http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinWiki][MoinMoin]] [[http://moinmo.in/AntiSpamGlobalSolution][AntiSpamGlobalSolution]]
regex's.  Anytime it detects that a saved page contains a string in the regex list, it _only_ refuses to save it.

*Major premise is not to create any unnecessary load on the server and not to use excess server resources by holding connections open.*

All its processing is _only_ done on =save=, or on =attach=.  (Foswiki:Extensions/BlackListPlugin does a lot of processing on _every_ topic operation, including view)

---+++ Features

   * Anti-spam features:
      * Fetches the spam signatures automatically (Not recommended!)
      * Scans each topic during Save and blocks save if a threshold of spam matches is exceeded.
      * Provides an exception for trusted users identified by a spam bypass group.
      * Scans attachments before save (Not recommended!)

   * User registration features
      * Checks new registrations against White and Black lists by either domain or IP address.
      * Provides a facility to remove users.

The attachment scan for spam strings and some javascript exploits is extremely slow and not recommended, especially for large binary attachments. This
feature is now disabled by default.

---+++ Spam signatures

This plugin can use a timeout on save to check if the spam signature list has changed, This is no longer recommended.  For best performance,
manually update the signatures.

To manually update the list, click
<form name="spamupddate" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{rest}%/%TOPIC%/forceUpdate" method="post">
<input type="submit" class="foswikiSubmit" value="Update regexes" />
</form>
(Admin authority required!)

The retrieve of the !MoinMoin regex list can still take some seconds which will delay topic saves when the list needs to be refreshed.  Good
network connectivity is a must.  If the configured server is not reachable, then save will be delayed or fail.
The recommended solution is to refresh the list using the provided =rest= script from a scheduled cron job, and disable =$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{AutoUpdateSignatures}=  (This is now the default configuration)
<verbatim>
cd [foswiki-bin-directory]
./rest /AntiWikiSpamPlugin/forceUpdate</verbatim>

Here is a sample =crontab= entry to run the signature refresh at 10 past the hour.
The ouptut is sent to a logfile.
<verbatim>
10      *       *       *       *       cd /path/to/foswiki/bin && perl -T rest /AntiWikiSpamPlugin/forceUpdate  /path/to/foswiki/working/logs/LastSpamUpdate.log 2>&1
</verbatim>


---+++ Registration control

Registration is controlled by limiting the email domains that can be used by people registering to the wiki.
For example, you can set up a whitelist so that only people with a corporate email address can register, or set up a blacklist to filter known email hosts that spammers use.

The lists are held in topics, usually called %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationWhiteList and %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationWhiteList.
Sample topics are provided. Each topic is a simple list of Perl regular expressions.  The domain of the email address is tested against the regular expressions. If there is no match
then the domain is reversed to an IP address, and it is also checked agains the list.  At least one expression in the whitelist must match the email address to permit registration.
If any expression in the blacklist matches, registration will be denied.

The core foswiki feature, added in Foswiki-1.1.5, provides a similar facility but only checks by email address domain.  It is a simpler implementation and has lower overhead.
The core filter is set as an expert parameter in the Foswiki configuration ={Register}{EmailFilter}=, in the "Security and Authentication" section, Registration tab.
The White and Black lists provided by this extension will do a DNS lookup and can also block by IP Address of the registrant.

---+++ Removing User Accounts

Normally user accounts should not be removed, as they represent the history of topic changes.  In addition if the WikiName is reused, the new user "assumes"
the history of the prior user.   However, when dealing with spam registrations, it's generally recommended to remove the accounts. This plugin
provides a REST handler that can remove user accounts from the wiki, which you can access through the following form.
   * The User will be removed from the Mapping manager if supported
      * On Foswiki versions prior to Foswiki 1.1.4,  the user will not be removed from the WikiUsers topic.
   * The User will be removed from any groups
   * The session file is removed to force loss of authentication of the user.
   * The User topic and any attachments are moved to the %TRASHWEB% Web as =SuspectSpammer&lt;WikiName&gt;&lt;timestamp&gt;=
*This function is only available to Administrators*

<!-- %JQREQUIRE{"ui, ui::autocomplete"}% -->
<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{rest}%/AntiWikiSpamPlugin/removeUser" method="post">
%INCLUDE{"%SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryAjaxHelper" section="userselector" INPUT_NAME="user" MULTI="false"}%
<input type="submit" class="foswikiSubmit" value="Remove User" />
</form>

This feature will be included as a core Foswiki feature in Foswiki 1.2.

---++ Configuration

The configuration of this plugin is done using the %SCRIPTURL{"configure"}% tool:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Setting* | *Definition* | *Default* |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{CheckTopics}= | Enable to check topic text against the spam regular expressions | (enabled) |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{CheckAttachments}= | Enable to check attachment text against the spam regular expressions | (disabled) |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{CheckRegistrations}= | Enable to check Registrations against the white and black lists. | (enabled) |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{AutoUpdateSignatures}= | Enable to auto-download spam signatures. | (disabled) |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{ANTISPAMREGEXLISTURL}= | URL containing the public list of regular expressions used to block spam. The default list is provided by !MoinMoin. | http://arch.thinkmo.de/cgi-bin/spam-merge |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{LOCALANTISPAMREGEXLISTTOPIC}= | A topic containing a list of local regular expressions. A sample topic is provided. | %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamLocalList |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{GETLISTTIMEOUT}= | Maximum age of the public regular expression list in minutes. When age is exceeded, an updated list will be fetched | 60 |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{BypassGroup}= | A Wiki group listing members who are permitted to save without any Spam checking. Note that members of the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup are always permitted to save. | AntiWikiSpamBypassGroup |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{HitThreshold}= | Number of regex hits required to block the save. Set to -1 to simulate operation.  | 1 |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{RegistrationWhiteList}= | Name of topic containing regular expressions that permit registration by matching email domains. | %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationWhiteList |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{RegistrationBlackList}= | Name of topic containing regular expressions that deny registration by matching email domains. | %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationBlackList |

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Testing

Edit %SANDBOXWEB%.AntiWikiSpamTestTopic using the Admin user.  (This topic is protected against non-admin access.)  Save will be permitted, but the matching
regular expressions will be logged to the foswiki error log (typically =working/logs/error.log=)

To cause a true failure, remove the VIEW and CHANGE restrictions to the topic and edit it using a non-admin user.
