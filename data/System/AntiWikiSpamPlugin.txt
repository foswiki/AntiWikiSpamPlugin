---++ Stop your wiki getting spammed
This plugin attempts to reduce the instance of Wiki Spam by using the
[[http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/][MoinMoin]]
[[http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/AntiSpamGlobalSolution][AntiSpamGlobalSolution]]
regex's.  Anytime it detects that a saved page contains a string in the regex
list, it _only_ refuses to save it.

*Major premise is not to create any unnecessary load on the server and not to use excess server resources by holding connections open.*

All its processing is _only_ done on save, or on attach.
(Foswiki:Extensions/BlackListPlugin does alot of processing on _every_ topic operation,
including view)

It uses a timeout on save to check if the list has changed, so if there are no
saves, there is no un-needed network traffic.

To manually update the list, click [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"rest"}%/%TOPIC%/forceUpdate][here]]
