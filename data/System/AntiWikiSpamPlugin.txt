---++ Stop your wiki getting spammed
This plugin attempts to reduce the instance of Wiki Spam by using the
[[http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinWiki][MoinMoin]]
[[http://moinmo.in/AntiSpamGlobalSolution][AntiSpamGlobalSolution]]
regex's.  Anytime it detects that a saved page contains a string in the regex
list, it _only_ refuses to save it.

It can also check new registrations to see if the email address used matches a blacklist (or whitelist).

*Major premise is not to create any unnecessary load on the server and not to use excess server resources by holding connections open.*

All its processing is _only_ done on =save=, or on =attach=.
(Foswiki:Extensions/BlackListPlugin does alot of processing on _every_ topic operation,
including view)

It uses a timeout on save to check if the list has changed, so if there are no
saves, there is no un-needed network traffic.  Alternatively the regex list
can be loaded by a cron script to minimize save overhead.

To manually update the list, click [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"rest"}%/%TOPIC%/forceUpdate][here]]

Note that the retrieve of the !MoinMoin regex list can still take some seconds
which will delay topic saves when the list needs to be refreshed.  For best
performance:
   * Refresh the list using the =rest= script from a scheduled cron job
<verbatim>
cd [foswiki-bin-directory]
./rest /AntiWikiSpamPlugin/forceUpdate
</verbatim>
   * Set the =GETLISTTIMEOUT= to a very large number so that the cron job will be the only source of updates

---++ Removing User Accounts

Normally user accounts should not be removed, as they represent the history of
topic changes.  In addition if the WikiName is reused, the new user "assumes"
the history of the prior user.   However, when dealing with spam
registrations, it's generally recommended to remove the accounts. This plugin
provides a REST handler that can remove user accounts from the wiki, which
you can access through the following form.
*This function is only available to Administrators*

<!-- %JQREQUIRE{"ui, ui::autocomplete"}% -->
<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{rest}%/AntiWikiSpamPlugin/removeUser" method="post">
%INCLUDE{"System.JQueryAjaxHelper" section="userselector" INPUT_NAME="user" MULTI="false"}%
<input type="submit" class="foswikiSubmit" value="Remove User" /> 
</form>

---++ Configuration

The configuration of this plugin is done using the %SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%
tool.  There are 5 settings used to control the operation and aggressiveness of
the spam filter:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Setting* | *Definition* | *Default* |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{ANTISPAMREGEXLISTURL}= | URL containing the public list of regular expressions used to block spam.  The default list is provided by !MoinMoin. | http://arch.thinkmo.de/cgi-bin/spam-merge |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{LOCALANTISPAMREGEXLISTTOPIC}= | A topic containing a list of local regular expressions. A sample topic is provided. | %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamLocalList |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{GETLISTTIMEOUT}= | Maximum age of the public regular expression list in minutes.  When age is exceeded, an updated list will be fetched | 60 |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{BypassGroup}= | A Wiki group listing members who are permitted to save without any Spam checking. Note that members of the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup are always permitted to save. | AntiWikiSpamBypassGroup |
| ={Plugins}{AntiWikiSpamPlugin}{HitThreshold}= | Number of regex hits required to block the save. Set to -1 to simulate operation.  | 1 |

---++ Registration
Registration is controlled by limiting the email domains that can be used by people registering to the wiki. For example, you can set up a whitelist so that only people with a corporate email address can register, or set up a blacklist to filter known email hosts that spammers use.

The lists are held in topics, usually called %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationWhiteList and %SYSTEMWEB%.AntiWikiSpamRegistrationWhiteList. Sample topics are provided. Each topic is a simple list of Perl regular expressions. At least one expression in the whitelist must match the email address to permit registration. If any expression in the blacklist matches, registration will be denied.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Testing

Edit %SANDBOXWEB%.AntiWikiSpamTestTopic using the Admin user.  (This topic is protected against non-admin access.)  Save will be permitted, but the matching
regular expressions will be logged to the foswiki error log (typically =working/logs/error.log=)

To cause a true failure, remove the VIEW and CHANGE restrictions to the topic and edit it using a non-admin user.
