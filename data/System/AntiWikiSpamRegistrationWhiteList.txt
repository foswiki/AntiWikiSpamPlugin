---++ List of local regular expressions
The below verbatim block is extracted and used as a list of Regular
Expressions for the AntiWikiSpamPlugin. Each line can contain a comment
starting with a #. Both the domain name and the corresponding IP address
(found by DNS lookup) are matched, so you can match either domain names or
IP addresses. The whitelist overrides the blacklist i.e. an address *must*
be found in the whitelist before the blacklist is checked. Don't forget to
escape full-stops in regular expressions!
